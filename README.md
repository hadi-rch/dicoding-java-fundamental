# Dicoding Java Fundamental Course Examples

This project contains a collection of Java examples from the Dicoding Java Fundamental course. Each example demonstrates different core Java concepts.

## Running the Examples

To run the examples, you will need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

1.  **Navigate to the `src` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd src
    ```

2.  **Compile the Java file you want to run.** For example, to compile the main OOP example:
    ```bash
    javac com/dicoding/javafundamental/basic/Main.java
    ```
    Or, to compile the generics example:
    ```bash
    javac com/dicoding/javafundamental/basic/generic/Main.java
    ```

3.  **Run the compiled Java code.** For example, to run the main OOP example:
    ```bash
    java com.dicoding.javafundamental.basic.Main
    ```
    Or, to run the generics example:
    ```bash
    java com.dicoding.javafundamental.basic.generic.Main
    ```

    **Note:** Some examples might require input files (e.g., `latihan_input.txt` for the stream example) to be present in the root directory of the project when running.

## Concepts Covered
